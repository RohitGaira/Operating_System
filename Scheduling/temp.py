        Once a message is received, this function sends a reply to the sender or stop.
        The reply can be generated automatically or entered manually by a human.

        Args:
            message (dict or str): message from the sender. If the type is dict, it may contain the following reserved fields (either content or function_call need to be provided).
                1. "content": content of the message, can be None.
                2. "function_call": a dictionary containing the function name and arguments.
                3. "role": role of the message, can be "assistant", "user", "function".
                    This field is only needed to distinguish between "function" or "assistant"/"user".
                4. "name": In most cases, this field is not needed. When the role is "function", this field is needed to indicate the function name.
                5. "context" (dict): the context of the message, which will be passed to
                    [Completion.create](../oai/Completion#create).
            sender: sender of an Agent instance.
            request_reply (bool or None): whether a reply is requested from the sender.
                If None, the value is determined by `self.reply_at_receive[sender]`.
            silent (bool or None): (Experimental) whether to print the message received.

        Raises:
            ValueError: if the message can't be converted into a valid ChatCompletion message.
